This MATLAB code demonstrates the geodesic active contour model using distance regularized
level sets for object tracking in videos.

The code can be run from the main file - "GeodesicActiveContour.m"
After running the main file, it needs, as input, the four vertices of the rectangular neighbourhood around
the object to be tracked.
